(** SHA1 OCaml binding *)

(** digest type - opaque *)
type t

(** Return the digest of the given string. *)
val string : string -> t

(** Sha1.substring s ofs len returns the digest of the substring of s starting
at character number ofs and containing len characters. *)
val substring : string -> int -> int -> t

(** If len is nonnegative, Sha1.channel ic len reads len characters from
channel ic and returns their digest, or raises End_of_file if end-of-file is
reached before len characters are read. If len is negative, Sha1.channel ic
len reads all characters from ic until end-of-file is reached and return their
digest. *)
val channel : in_channel -> int -> t

(** Return the digest of the file whose name is given. *)
val file : string -> t

(** Return the digest of the file whose name is given using fast C function *)
val file_fast : string -> t

(** Write a digest on the given output channel. *)
val output : out_channel -> t -> unit

(** Read a digest from the given input channel. *)
val input : in_channel -> t

(** return a printable hexadecimal representation of the given digest *)
